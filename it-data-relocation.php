			<p>Through the process of acquiring new equipment and merging data centers, the ability to manage all of the assets becomes increasingly difficult. With our assessment services we can provide a comprehensive audit of the current environment to determine areas where you can improve efficiency. The results enable you to reduce technology costs while increasing reliability and and system performance.</p>

<p>As a data center moves to a new location, consolidates within an existing data center, or merges with another data center, we provide you with a plan for meeting the requirements of the new environment. This includes the placement of equipment, changes to environmental needs, and network design, all of which provide you with the satisfaction of knowing the new data center can operate at optimal levels.</p>

<p>In addition, whether your're moving into a new data center or managing an ever-growing data center, MartinCFS technicians can provide cabling solutions to steamline your cabling infrastructure. No more tangled “spaghetti” under the floor. .</p>

		<p>Over the course of time and physical changes to the facility, data centers can begin to experience equipment issues caused by less than desirable operating environment. MartinCFS can provide an assessment of the current environment and the process of “cleaning” that environment to reduce or eliminate equipment issues.</p>

		<p>A component of the turnkey relocation is the deinstallation of the equipment at the current site and the reinstallation at the new location. When necessary, MartinCFS will contract with all major OEM’s for warranty/maintenance to ensure the equipment will continue to be maintained at the proper levels once in its new location.</p>

		<p>Once equipment has been deinstalled, MartinCFS will either use packing materials you provide or secure anti-static and OEM packing materials required for each piece of equipment being moved. Custom crating and security seals are used to ensure the safety of the equipment. Lift gate transportation in climate-controlled vehicles also will be arranged, along with insurance on the equipment during the physical move to the new location a. If required, MartinCFS will also secure warehousing and storage in the event of a delayed delivery.</p>

		<p>As equipment leases end and technology turnover causes hardware to become obsolete, data center managers have find themselves faced with disposing of equipment. MartinCFS will deinstall the hardware and dispose of each piece as required . This includes possible packaging and transportation to another location (for equipment resale of storage), or equipment destruction.</p>

		<p> Increasing data security issues have triggered a corresponding increase in the number of regulatory requirements that govern the protection of personal information. This is causing companies to continually review their protection procedures in an effort to continually meet the regulations while maintaining day to day management of the data.</p>

<p>One area of growing concern is data contained on disk or tape that might be leaving the data center due to technology turnover or lease expirations. In addition, there are disk failures within arrays that have become a regular event. When data is leaving the data center for any or all of these reasons, how do you eradicate that data in the most cost-effective manner? MartinCFS provides a service that completely eradicates data from hard disk drives and tape, which helps ensure your data security and regulatory compliance.</p>
